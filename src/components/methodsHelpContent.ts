    description: 'Symmetric similarity measure that compares two sets by dividing the size of their intersection by the size of their union. It is insensitive to set size but penalizes pairs that differ greatly in cardinality.',

    description: 'Symmetric similarity measure that counts each shared element twice relative to the sum of set sizes. Compared with Jaccard it gives more weight to the overlap and is therefore more forgiving for small sets.',
