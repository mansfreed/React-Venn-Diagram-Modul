## Submission — v2.4.1

This is an update of the CRAN package `vennDiagramLab` (current CRAN
version 2.0.5). It rolls up the additive feature work released as 2.2.2
and 2.2.3 on GitHub, plus a version-sync bump to 2.4.1 so that the R,
Python, and web-tool components share a single version line (the Python
companion `venn-diagram-lab` 2.4.1 is on PyPI and the web tool is on 2.4.x).

No breaking changes, no removed APIs, no defunct functions. `render_venn_svg()`
still returns a plain `character` vector, preserving the 2.0.x public API.

### What changed since the CRAN 2.0.5 release

All changes are additive. New exported functions (following 2.0.5
conventions):

* Statistics and summary plots:
  `item_share_distribution()`, `cluster_set_order()`,
  `render_share_distribution()`, `render_cluster_heatmap()`,
  `render_enrichment_bar()`, `render_enrichment_lollipop()`.
* Region inspection / selection:
  `intersection_items()`, `exclusive_items()`, `union_items()`,
  `parse_region_expression()` (a small Boolean DSL — `& | + ~ !`, atoms
  `A..I` — returning a sorted integer vector of region bitmasks).
* Export:
  `to_excel_workbook()` (3-sheet xlsx) and `to_zip_report()`
  (PDF + SVGs + TSVs + xlsx + README bundle).

New parameters on existing functions:

* `render_venn_svg(show_items =, item_options =, highlight =)`.
* `to_pdf_report(include_share =, include_cluster =)`.

New `Imports`: `openxlsx` and `zip` (both pure R).

Version 2.4.1 itself adds no new R code over 2.2.3 — it is a version-only
synchronisation release.

### Carried over from the accepted 2.0.5 submission

* `inst/CITATION` uses the auto-injected `meta` object (so it does not
  error during the pre-install incoming-feasibility check).
* Every vignette gates its heavy chunks with
  `knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = NOT_CRAN)`, so the on-CRAN vignette
  rebuild is essentially text-only and the overall checktime stays well
  under 10 minutes. The heavy chunks still run on the GitHub Actions CI
  matrix and under `devtools::check()`.

### Test environments

* Local: macOS (Apple Silicon), R 4.6.0 — `R CMD check --as-cran` on the
  vignette-built tarball.
* GitHub Actions (`R CMD check --as-cran`):
  * ubuntu-latest — R 4.6.0 (release), R-devel (2026-06-08 r90120), R 4.5.3 (oldrel-1)
  * macos-latest — R 4.6.0 (release)
  * windows-latest — R 4.6.0 (release)

### R CMD check results

`Status: OK` — 0 ERRORs | 0 WARNINGs | 0 NOTEs on every environment above,
including the local `--as-cran` run (the CRAN incoming-feasibility sub-check
also reports OK).

The version number deliberately jumps from the CRAN 2.0.5 to 2.4.1; the
intermediate 2.2.x / 2.4.0 versions were published on GitHub only and are
folded into this submission. The rationale (cross-package version lockstep) is
described above.

### Downstream dependencies

None — `vennDiagramLab` has no reverse dependencies on CRAN (verified against
the current CRAN package index).

### Companion packages

`vennDiagramLab` is the R companion to the
[`venn-diagram-lab` Python package](https://pypi.org/project/venn-diagram-lab/)
(2.4.1 on PyPI) and the [Venn Diagram Lab web
tool](https://www.venndiagramlab.org/). The three implementations share the
same SVG model library and produce byte-equivalent TSV outputs, verified by
parity tests against shared golden fixtures.

### Notes for the reviewer

* Five bundled sample datasets in `inst/extdata/samples/` (~250 KB total)
  cover both biological (cancer drivers, MSigDB pathways) and mock
  (streaming platforms, gene sets) scenarios — all used in the eight
  vignettes for fully self-contained execution.
* `inst/extdata/models/` contains 44 SVG model templates + 44 JSON region
  files (~700 KB total) from a dozen published Venn / Edwards / Grünbaum /
  Anderson / Carroll / Mamakani / SUMO construction methods — bundled for
  byte-equivalent rendering parity with the web tool.
