# Release runbook — vennDiagramLab (R)

Operator-facing checklist for releasing the R package to CRAN and
Bioconductor and minting a Zenodo DOI. R submissions are manual (no OIDC
auto-publish like Python's PyPI flow) — this runbook documents each step.

The parallel doc for Python is `../python/RELEASE.md`.

## One-time setup (do this before v2.0.0)

### 1. Verify Zenodo-GitHub integration

Already enabled if `CITATION.cff::doi` is populated (currently
`10.5281/zenodo.20000599` from the v2.0.0 web/Python release).

Verify at https://zenodo.org/account/settings/github/ that
`ZoliQua/Venn-Diagram-Lab` is toggled **ON**. From now on, every GitHub
release Zenodo sees will be archived and assigned a fresh DOI.

### 2. Bioconductor support site (one-time, already done in Phase 8)

Maintainer email `ssdbtc@gmail.com` is registered at
https://support.bioconductor.org/ and `vennDiagramLab` is added to Watched
Tags in the maintainer profile. BiocCheck verifies this automatically.

### 3. (Recommended) Subscribe to Bioc-Devel mailing list

https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/bioc-devel — for release-cycle
announcements + build-failure notifications. Not strictly required (BiocCheck
emits a NOTE if it cannot verify subscription, but does not fail).

## Per-release checklist

For each R release (e.g. v2.0.0, v2.0.1, ...):

### A. Pre-release verification

1. **All 5 R CMD check CI cells green** on main (Linux release/devel/oldrel
   + macOS + Windows):
   ```bash
   gh run list --workflow r-cmd-check.yml --branch main --limit 1
   ```
2. **BiocCheck CI green** on main (now blocking after Phase 9):
   ```bash
   gh run list --workflow r-bioc-check.yml --branch main --limit 1
   ```
3. **pkgdown site live** at https://zoliqua.github.io/Venn-Diagram-Lab/r/.
4. **Local R CMD check --as-cran** clean (≤1 NOTE — only "New submission"
   for v2.0.0 first submission):
   ```bash
   cd /Users/Zoli/Code/Orthologs/2-venn-diagram
   R CMD build r
   R CMD check --as-cran vennDiagramLab_2.0.0.tar.gz | tail -10
   ```
5. **Local BiocCheck** clean (0 ERROR / 0 WARNING):
   ```bash
   Rscript -e 'BiocCheck::BiocCheck("vennDiagramLab_2.0.0.tar.gz")' | tail -5
   ```

### B. Bump version (if iterating past v2.0.0)

For v2.0.0 (the first R release), `r/DESCRIPTION::Version` is already
`2.0.0` — no bump needed.

For subsequent releases (v2.0.1, v2.0.2, ...):
1. Edit `r/DESCRIPTION` `Version: 2.0.X` → `Version: 2.0.Y`.
2. Add new entry to `r/NEWS.md` at the top (under the existing v2.0.0 block).
3. Commit:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/Zoli/Code/Orthologs/2-venn-diagram
   git -c user.name="Zoltán Dul" -c user.email="ssdbtc@gmail.com" \
       commit -am "chore(r): bump to 2.0.Y for next CRAN release"
   git push origin main
   ```

### C. Tag and push (R-specific tag pattern)

**Tag naming:** Use `r-v2.0.0` for R releases. The Python publish workflow
(`python-publish.yml`) is triggered by the `v[2-9].*.*` glob pattern, so
plain `v2.0.0` tags would also fire it (incorrectly). The `r-` prefix
disambiguates.

```bash
cd /Users/Zoli/Code/Orthologs/2-venn-diagram
git checkout main && git pull
git tag r-v2.0.0
git push origin r-v2.0.0
```

This does NOT trigger any auto-publish workflow (R has no PyPI-like
auto-upload). It just creates the immutable git tag for reference.

### D. Create the GitHub Release

```bash
cd /Users/Zoli/Code/Orthologs/2-venn-diagram
gh release create r-v2.0.0 \
    --title "vennDiagramLab R 2.0.0 — first CRAN + Bioconductor release" \
    --notes "$(awk '/^## v2.0.0/{flag=1; print; next} /^## v[0-9]/{flag=0} flag' r/NEWS.md)" \
    --verify-tag
```

The `--notes` shell pipeline extracts the v2.0.0 section from `r/NEWS.md`
(everything between the `## v2.0.0` heading and the next `## v` heading).

Zenodo will pick up the release within a few minutes and mint a fresh DOI.

### E. CRAN submission

The recommended path is `devtools::release()` — interactive, walks through
all checks + uploads via the CRAN web form.

```bash
cd /Users/Zoli/Code/Orthologs/2-venn-diagram
Rscript -e 'devtools::release(pkg = "r")'
```

The interactive prompts (paraphrased):

```
Have you checked for spelling errors (with spelling::spell_check_package())?
> y
Have you run R CMD check on the package?
> y
Are CRAN incoming feasibility NOTEs OK? (i.e. only the "New submission" NOTE)
> y
Have you addressed all reverse dependencies (revdep)?
> y      # No reverse deps for a new package
Are you ready to upload?
> y
```

`devtools` builds the tarball, opens the CRAN web form in your browser
pre-filled with submission notes from `r/cran-comments.md`, and uploads.
You'll receive a confirmation email from CRAN within a few minutes asking
to confirm the submission.

**Then:**

* Open the email, click the confirmation link.
* Wait 1-2 days for the automated CRAN incoming-checks bot.
* Wait 1-2 weeks for the human CRAN reviewer.
* Expect 2-3 review rounds for first submission. Common requests:
  * Tone down `Description:` (remove marketing language)
  * Add `\value{}` documentation to any function the reviewer thinks is
    missing one (Phase 8 Task B6 audit confirmed all 30 are present, but
    sometimes reviewers want explicit non-`invisible()` returns documented)
  * Provide `\dontrun{}` justification (we use `\donttest{}` already; should
    be fine)
  * Adjust `Authors@R` cre vs aut roles
* For each review feedback round: address in code, bump to v2.0.X+1, push,
  re-run `devtools::release()`.
* On acceptance: package live on https://cran.r-project.org/package=vennDiagramLab
  within 1-2 days, mirrored worldwide.

### F. Bioconductor submission

Bioconductor submission goes through a public issue tracker. The Bioc
Single Package Builder (SPB) auto-checks the package across all platforms
+ Bioc dependencies.

1. **Open the contribution issue:**
   * URL: https://github.com/Bioconductor/Contributions/issues/new
   * Title: `vennDiagramLab`
   * Body template:
     ```
     - **Update the following URL to point to the GitHub repository of
       the package you wish to submit to Bioconductor**
       AdditionalPackage: https://github.com/ZoliQua/Venn-Diagram-Lab
     ```
   * The `AdditionalPackage:` URL must end at the repository root (not
     `/r`). Bioc SPB handles the `r/` subdir via the `bioc.subdir` field
     in the package's BiocManager metadata.
2. **Within minutes:** the SPB bot leaves a comment with the build status
   across Bioc-supported R versions and platforms.
3. **First-pass typical issues:** SPB may flag missing biocViews terms,
   missing methods documentation, or version-mismatch with Bioc devel
   branch. Address in code + push to main; SPB re-checks automatically.
4. **Manual review (4-8 weeks):** a Bioc team member + community reviewers
   read the package + ask questions in the issue thread.
5. **On acceptance:** package added to next Bioconductor release branch
   (releases happen every 6 months, April + October).
6. **Initial Bioc version:** Bioc convention is `0.99.X` for first
   submission (becomes `1.0.X` upon release). Our spec keeps `2.0.0` to
   match the unified monorepo version. The reviewer may request a
   `0.99.X` version specifically — if so, bump `r/DESCRIPTION::Version`
   to `0.99.0`, push, re-trigger SPB.

The CRAN submission and Bioc submission can run **in parallel** — they're
independent registries.

### G. Zenodo DOI verification

After the GitHub release in step D fires, Zenodo automatically:

1. Archives the source tarball at the release tag.
2. Mints a fresh DOI under the same Zenodo "concept" (parent DOI =
   `10.5281/zenodo.20000599`).
3. Emails the maintainer (`ssdbtc@gmail.com`) with the new version-specific
   DOI within ~5-10 minutes.

**Verify:**
1. Go to https://zenodo.org/account/settings/github/ and find the entry for
   `ZoliQua/Venn-Diagram-Lab`. The latest release (`r-v2.0.0`) should be
   listed with its own DOI link.
2. Update `CITATION.cff::doi` to the new version-specific DOI:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/Zoli/Code/Orthologs/2-venn-diagram
   # Edit CITATION.cff: doi: "10.5281/zenodo.<new_id>"
   git -c user.name="Zoltán Dul" -c user.email="ssdbtc@gmail.com" \
       commit -am "docs: update Zenodo DOI for vennDiagramLab R v2.0.0"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. (Optional) Add a DOI badge to `r/README.md`:
   ```markdown
   [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.<new_id>.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.<new_id>)
   ```

### H. Post-acceptance checklist

Once both CRAN and Bioconductor accept (~2-6 weeks total):

1. Update `r/README.md` install line to mention `install.packages` works
   for end-users.
2. Open issue templates for users to report bugs at the support site (Bioc)
   and GitHub Issues (CRAN-style).
3. Plan next release cycle. For Bioc, the cycle is 6-monthly; bump to
   v2.1.0 in Bioc-devel branch (per Bioc's odd-MINOR convention) shortly
   after acceptance.

## Rollback

If a CRAN release is broken:

* **CRAN cannot be rolled back** — versions are immutable.
* Submit a patch release (v2.0.1) with the fix.
* Optionally email cran@r-project.org asking for the broken version to be
  archived early.

If a Bioc release is broken:

* Bioc is more forgiving — you can push fixes to the release branch within
  the same 6-month cycle.
* Use `git tag RELEASE_3_19` (or current) and push to bioc-git mirror.

## Common gotchas

* **CRAN URL check** — every URL in DESCRIPTION + man pages + vignettes is
  HTTP-HEAD'd. Broken URLs become NOTEs. We worked around this in Phase 8
  by pointing README to the GitHub tree (gh-pages was not yet live);
  Phase 9 reverts that once gh-pages is deployed.
* **CRAN policy: examples must run in <5s each** — our `\donttest{}`
  examples are exempt from this when CRAN runs `R CMD check` (not
  `--run-donttest`). The `r-cmd-check.yml` CI cells DO run `--run-donttest`
  to catch real failures.
* **Bioc reviewer style preferences** — Bioc reviewers sometimes prefer
  `vapply` over `sapply`, `seq_len(n)` over `1:n`, BiocStyle vignettes
  over rmarkdown::html_vignette. We use the latter; this is acceptable
  for the v2.0.0 release.
* **Zenodo DOI ordering** — the parent (concept) DOI stays the same across
  versions; only version-specific DOIs change. Cite the parent DOI in
  CITATION.cff for "this software" and the version-specific DOI in
  release notes.
